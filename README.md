# 💧 Water Detection using Blue Band Segmentation

This project implements a CNN-based semantic segmentation model that detects and analyzes the presence of water in satellite images using the **blue spectral band**.  
It classifies regions into two categories:
- **Water**
- **No Water**

Additionally, it generates **percentage-based analysis** of each category, enabling better monitoring of surface water conditions.

## 🚀 Features

- Blue band–focused semantic segmentation
- Pixel-wise water classification (Water / Partial / No Water)
- Percentage-level water content output
- Bar chart and visual map generation
- Lightweight CNN architecture suitable for real-time or onboard CubeSat applications
